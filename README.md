# Unity Platform Game

## Introduction
This project was developed by a team of three students as part of our coursework. In this game, players will embark on a thrilling adventure filled with challenges, requiring skill and precision to overcome.

## Concept
- **Single Player Experience**: The game is designed for single-player enjoyment, where players must demonstrate agility and precision to navigate through the levels.
- **Platformer Gameplay**: Each level consists of a series of static and moving platforms, offering at least two paths from the start to the endpoint. The level design presents risks of falling and losing "lives".
- **Key Collection**: Throughout the level, there are three keys that players must collect to complete it successfully.
- **Scoring System**: The player's objective is to achieve the highest score possible, determined by the number of lives retained, coins collected, enemies defeated, and gameplay time.
- **Enemies and Obstacles**: Enemies patrol predefined paths on the level, posing a threat to the player. Colliding with an enemy results in the loss of a life and respawning at a safe point or the level start. Players can either avoid or neutralize enemies by jumping on them or using other methods.

## Project Specifications
- **Unity Version**: 2022.3.10f1.
- **Character**: a fox from the Sunny Land package.
- **Graphics**: Level elements utilize graphics that correspond to the Sunny Land package, maintaining a rasterized, low-poly aesthetic.
- **Use of Assets**: only free assets are used, and the game does not violate any licensing agreements related to the utilized assets.
